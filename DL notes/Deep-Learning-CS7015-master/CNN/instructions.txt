To train the CNN, execute run.sh

Supported Parameters in train.py are:
Xavier, He and random weight initialisation
batch_size
learning rate

We have implemented Batch Normalization,dropout, data augmentation, guided backpropagation(model needs to be trained), t-SNE visualization and fooling.
The respective ipython notebooks are in /code directory.

In the /kaggle directory, we have included our best submissions and the tensorflow checkpoints.

We also performed all these experiments with MNIST dataset also.
