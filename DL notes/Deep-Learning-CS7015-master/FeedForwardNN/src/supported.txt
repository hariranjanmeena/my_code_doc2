# The supported features are :

--loss: ce,sq
--activation: tanh, sigmoid

Note :
We are storing the weights of the kaggle submissions in ../logs/kaggle/<model_no>/parameters/
Source code for all the experiments and kaggle submissions are in the Assignment1.ipynb notebook.
The best model is in ../logs/kaggle/5/parameters/

Weights are stored in .csv files where each cell(if opened in Excel viewer) is a weight matrix.
Though the weights are stored, we're unable to provide you with the pretrain parameter in run.sh. 
One might use the pandas dataframe to read these weights and use them.
