# Sequence to Sequence Network

Generating natural language description for structured data such as a table is an important task as it helps in easy and fast retrieval of information. Textual data is ever increasing, therefore we need to find some way to condense this data while preserving the information and meaning. 
In this assignment, we have used the WeatherGov data to create summaries where each weather record data is represented by a vector by itâ€™s record type, record time and record values.

### Prerequisites
Refer to the tensorflow's [NMT Model](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt) for prerequisites.

## Running the tests
Follow the instructions given in `code/instructions.txt` file.

## Experiments
Please find all the experiments that we conducted in the `report.pdf`.

## Acknowledgments
* We have modified tensorflow's [NMT Model](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt) for experimenting with advanced concepts. The modified nmt code can be found in /code/nmt/ directory.
* We also used [Hvass-Labs](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials) as reference. It's awesome! Do check it out.
